# Data-Cleaning-using-Pandas

In my previous mini-project, I obtained data by Web Scraping a Wikipedia page using the Beautiful Soup library in Python.
Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_accidents_and_incidents_resulting_in_at_least_50_fatalities 

Now, I have tried my hand at Data Cleaning/Wrangling using the Pandas library in Python. The data contains 549 rows and 13 columns. 
Since the data is obtained by scraping a HTML page, there were quite a few data cells that included HTML tags and data-format issues.

I started off by examining the data type of each column. Using Excel, I analysed the various data anomalies that were present in each column and included code to exclude (or) drop (or) transform data as required. 

The final cleaned data is exported as an Excel(.xlsx) file for analysis and visualization.
